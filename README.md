Design PCR primers for different bacteria for diagnosis
1. Download different sequences of different bacteria.
2. Perform multiple sequence alignment.
3. Perform a phylogenetic tree for different bacteria.
4. Perform a primer design for the exclusive parts in each bacterium.
5. Validate primers.
6. Automation of your steps is a plus.
